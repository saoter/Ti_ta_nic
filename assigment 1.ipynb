    "Today's assignment was inspired by a student's question, wondering if network analysis could be applied to the Titanic dataset. Instead of using the somewhat tragic dataset about surviving or perishing in the Titanic disaster, we will focus on the events leading up to it and try to solve the mystery behind why Rose didn't help Jack from dying.\n",

    "One example is [Violet Jessop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERDHDAR3ZsU&ab_channel=titanicstories), a woman who survived the RMS Olympic (1911), RMS Titanic (1912), and later the HMHS Britannic (1916), which sank after hitting a German naval mine. In the film, she was depicted as an elderly Third-Class stewardess, instead of a First-Class stewardess who was about 24 years old.\n"
